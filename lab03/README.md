# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project focuses on predicting Titanic survival using machine learning models. By analyzing features such as whether a passenger was alone, their age, and family size, the goal is to determine the most effective model for predicting survival.

## Objectives
- Train different machine learning models to predict Titanic survival.
- Evaluate model performance based on features such as alone, age, and family size.
- Compare the accuracy and reliability of the Decision Tree, Neural Network, and SVM models.

## Features Used
- **Alone**: Indicates whether the passenger was traveling alone.
- **Age**: The age of the passenger.
- **Family Size**: The number of family members aboard the Titanic with the passenger.

## Models
1. **Decision Tree**: Used for predicting survival based on the provided features.
2. **Neural Network (MLP)**: Multi-Layer Perceptron model used to predict survival.
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A classifier to predict survival based on the features, evaluated with different kernels.
